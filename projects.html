        <h2>MCM Competition</h2>
        <p class="project-subtitle">Sustainable Tourism Modeling in Alaska</p>
        <p>
            Competed in a team-based mathematical modeling competition where we developed a 
            differential equation model to analyze the environmental and economic impact of 
            cruise tourism in Juneau, Alaska. Our goal was to design a sustainable tourism 
            framework that balanced revenue generation with a 60% reduction in carbon dioxide 
            emissions, while respecting the city’s 16,000 visitor daily cap.
        </p>

        <div class="collapse" id="mcmMore">
            <p>
                We constructed a system of differential equations incorporating logistic growth 
                and linear functions to model tourism growth, revenue optimization, environmental 
                degradation, and policy constraints. By analyzing variables such as tourist 
                spending, carbon emissions per visitor, and tourism growth and loss rates, we 
                identified strategies that would allow Juneau to increase revenue while reducing 
                its environmental footprint.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our model demonstrated how strategic pricing adjustments and reinvestment 
                into eco-friendly infrastructure could simultaneously preserve natural resources 
                and sustain economic growth. We also explored how this framework could be adapted 
                to other tourism-dependent destinations with different capacity and environmental 
                constraints.

        <h2>Saint Mary's Sustainable Farm Analysis</h2>
        <p class="project-subtitle">Analyzing the Social Impact of the Local Sustainable Farm</p>
        <p>
            This project examined what drives community members to attend the Saint Mary’s sustainable farm market. 
            Working in a team, we collaboratively designed the survey and cleaned the raw data to ensure accurate and meaningful results. 
            Individually, I analyzed the survey responses to explore how produce quality, variety, and quantity influenced attendance, 
            considering different roles within the campus community (students, faculty, staff, and others) and attendance frequency.
        </p>

        <div class="collapse" id="datathonMore">
            <p>
                My analysis revealed that most market attendees are staff or on-campus students, with quality of produce generally valued more 
            than variety or quantity. Attendance frequency did not strongly affect preferences, and nearly all respondents agreed that 
            the market is an important resource. While some statistical tests were limited by survey design constraints, these insights 
            highlighted key factors that contribute to community engagement and the farm’s social impact.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also proposed survey redesign improvements to allow more independent ranking of produce attributes, which would enable 
                deeper statistical analysis in future iterations. This project demonstrated how collaborative efforts in data collection and 
                cleaning, combined with individual analysis, can provide actionable insights to support local sustainability initiatives.
