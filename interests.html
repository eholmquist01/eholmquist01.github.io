                <h2 class="section-title">Rowing</h2>

                <p>
                    My journey in rowing began as a high school athlete, where I first learned 
                    the discipline, resilience, and teamwork that define the sport. Rowing 
                    challenged me physically and mentally, teaching me to push through discomfort, 
                    trust those around me, and pursue constant improvement.
                </p>

                <div class="extra-content collapse">
                    <p>
                        That foundation carried into my work with Sparks Camps, where I grew 
                        from athlete to mentor. As a <b>Program Leader</b>, I guided high school 
                        rowers while sharing my experience as a college student. 
                        Through this role, I developed skills in leadership, logistics, organization, 
                        and—most importantly—connection.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My involvement with Sparks continued to evolve. What began in athlete mentorship 
                        expanded into an internship as a Social Media Coordinator and later into a 
                        <b>Social Media Manager</b> role. I produced content across platforms, managed 
                        summer media strategy at camp, implemented improved photo management systems, 
                        and coordinated remotely with educators across multiple locations. 
                        These experiences strengthened my communication, initiative, and confidence 
                        in building structure within evolving and loosely defined roles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have since stepped into a <b>Data Analyst</b> role at Sparks — a newly established 
                        position that I am helping to build from the ground up. In this role, I am pioneering 
                        data-driven approaches to support marketing decisions, developing systems 
                        and processes that did not previously exist within the organization. At the same time, 
                        I work closely with a talented marketing team, learning from their expertise in branding, 
                        storytelling, and audience engagement. Collaborating across disciplines has deepened my 
                        understanding of how data and creativity intersect to drive meaningful impact.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Rowing has been foundational to my growth — not only as an athlete, but as a 
                        leader, communicator, and problem solver. What began as a sport I joined with 
                        friends has become the foundation for the opportunities I have pursued, the 
                        places I have traveled, and the values of discipline and hard work that guide me.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Today, I continue rowing with the South Bend Community Rowing Club Master’s 
                        team, maintaining the connection to a sport that has shaped so much of who I am.

                <p>
                    In the fall semester of 2025, I had the opportunity to serve as a <b>Teaching Fellow</b>
                    for a Responsible & Ethical AI course through the National Education
                    Opportunity Network (NEON) as part of the ITREDS Scholars Program at
                    Notre Dame.
                </p>

                <div class="extra-content collapse">
                    <p>
                        In this role, I led weekly virtual sessions for high school scholars, guiding discussions on 
                        foundational machine learning concepts and the ethical implications of artificial intelligence.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Teaching this course strengthened my ability to communicate technical ideas clearly and thoughtfully, 
                        while encouraging students to critically examine the societal impact of emerging technologies. 
                        Beyond instruction, I also supported students in navigating the college process — discussing financial aid, 
                        academic life, and what it means to be a student at Notre Dame.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This experience deepened my passion for mentorship and reaffirmed my desire to make complex ideas accessible, 
                        empowering others through education and leadership.

                <h2 class="section-title">Travel</h2>

                <p>
                    My curiosity for travel was first sparked through my work with Sparks Camps in various locations, and it truly ignited during the summer I spent studying abroad in London.
                </p>

                <div class="extra-content collapse">
                    <p>
                        Working at camps in different cities and countries exposed me to leaders, athletes, and educators 
                        with backgrounds and experiences very different from my own. Conversations with them 
                        broadened my perspective and sparked a growing curiosity about the world — how culture, 
                        history, and environment shape the way we think, lead, and learn.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        That curiosity eventually led me abroad. While studying in London, I immersed myself 
                        in a city layered with history, and I also had the opportunity to travel to Rome — 
                        walking through spaces that hold centuries of global influence and cultural meaning. 
                        Experiencing these places firsthand deepened my appreciation for the historical forces 
                        that shape our present world.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        During that same summer, I served at a Sparks camp in Cambridge, where I learned more 
                        about the rich history of rowing — a sport that has shaped so much of my own growth. 
                        Understanding the traditions of rowing in such a historic setting gave me a new respect 
                        for how sport, culture, and history intersect.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Travel has taught me that perspective is not fixed — it expands with every conversation, 
                        every unfamiliar street, and every shared experience. What began as camp leadership 
                        became a deeper desire to understand the world more fully and learn from experiences 
                        different than my own.
                    </p>

                <p>
                    My interest in Data Science began at the intersection of Mathematics and Computer Science — my two majors — and the opportunity to apply analytical skills toward meaningful social impact.

                        I was drawn to ITREDS because it offers both technical depth and ethical perspective. 
                        Through coursework in data science and data ethics, the opportunity to teach a Responsible 
                        & Ethical AI course, and hands-on experience in a capstone project, the program reflects the 
                        interdisciplinary approach that I value in the field.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Beyond ITREDS, my coursework at Saint Mary's College has further developed my technical 
                        foundation, including graduate-level studies in Data Visualization and Python for Data 
                        Science. I am also excited to join Steelcase in Summer 2026 as a Data Science/IT Intern.

                    <p>
                        In addition, for my senior comprehensive project, I am studying neural networks and their application 
                        to image classification, with the goal of developing a recommendation system informed by 
                        deep learning techniques. This project allows me to explore how deep learning models are redefining 
                        data-driven decision-making across industries.
